# Yeeun Minimal Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

A clean, white, minimal portfolio in the style you requested.

## How to deploy

1) Create a repo named `USERNAME.github.io` on GitHub.
2) Upload `index.html`, `sound-design.html`, and `style.css` to the root of the repo.
3) In the repo: Settings → Pages → Source = Deploy from a branch → branch = `main` (root).
4) Visit `https://USERNAME.github.io`.

## Customize

- Edit text in `index.html` and `sound-design.html` (name, tagline, links).
- Replace YouTube `iframe` `src` with your own video URLs.
- Change contact links in the CONTACT section.
- For more projects, duplicate a `<article class="card">…</article>` block.
